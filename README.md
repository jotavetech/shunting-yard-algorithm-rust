# Rust Calculator

## This is a rust calculator made using shunting yard algorithm and reverse polish notation.

This project was made to learn how to build a calculator without use `eval()` function.

# How to run?

Create a clone of this repository and enter on directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jotavetech/shunting-yard-algorithm-rust
$ cd shunting-yard-algorithm-rust
```

To run this project you will also need the [Rust Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/pt-BR/tools/install) installed.

With everything done, run it using `cargo run` command in your terminal and type an simple expression, without using (), just + - / \* and numbers.

```bash
$ cargo run

Enter your expression:
> 20 + 10 / 2 * 3

Result of your expression is 35
```
